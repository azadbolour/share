My current (as yet unsuccessful) attempt at proving the group axioms 
for plus in modular arithmetic.

In representing numbers modulo some modulus, I wanted to preserve the following
basic properties:

- For a given modulus, there are exactly 'modulus' representatives of natural
  numbers modulo that modulus, corresponding to 0, 1, ... (modulus - 1).

- The representatives of modular numbers have a circular successor/predecessor
  relationship. These relationships are inherited from those of corresponding
  natural numbers, except at the boundaries of 0 and (modulus - 1), where to
  form a circular sequence, we'd need the successor of (modulus - 1) to be 0,
  and the predecessor of 0 to be (modulus - 1).

A simple representation is a dependent pair consisting of a natural number
together with a proof that it is less than the modulus: 

    (n: Nat ** S n `LTE` modulus)

Let's call this a 'modulo dependent pair'.

To represent modulo dependent pairs in a sequence, we can use two functions, say
succ, pred:

succ : (n: Nat ** LtModulus n) -> (m: Nat ** LtModulus m)
pred : (m: Nat ** LtModulus m) -> (n: Nat ** LtModulus n)

The idea then is to define modular plus in terms of the functions succ and pred,
then to prove propositions about modular plus by using lemmas about the succ and
pred functions.

I am hoping that the following lemmas on succ and pred would be sufficient to
prove the properties of modular plus needed for the group axioms.

succ (pred mx) = mx
pred (succ mx) = mx

succ mx + my = succ (mx + my)
mx + succ my = succ (mx + my)

pred mx + my = pred (mx + my)
mx + pred my = succ (mx + my)

So far I have set this up and have a simple definition of modular plus in terms
of the successor function. But I have not been successful in proving much with
it.
