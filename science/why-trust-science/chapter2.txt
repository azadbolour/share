Why Trust in Science: Chapter 2

In this chapter, Oreskes uses a number of recent episodes of scientific
controversy to further expand on her main emphasis on consensus.

Here are my brief notes on this chapter.

Ideally there should be a convergence of opinion between scientists and the
general public. But there is widespread mistrust of settled science among the
general public. The distrust cannot be attributed to a lack of expertise alone,
as evidenced by the fact that educated democrats and educated republicans differ
the most on their disbeliefs of scientific claims. 

Ideological considerations appear to be the major motivators of doubt in science. 

The argument for distrust is bolstered by the instability of scientific facts.
The philosopher Larry Lauden has called this type of distrust "the pessimistic
meta-induction of the history of science". A favorite example of science deniers
is the ever-changing nutritional guidelines.

One answer to the issue of instability is that over time our standards of
rationality improve, and the new standards point to improvements in scietific
knowledge. 

But to sharpen the debate, Oreskes restricts her attention to quite recent
controversies and instabilities. Arguably, our standards have not changed radically
during the periods of these incidents. Oreskes examines each of 5 cases of
recent controversy and reversal in light of consensus.
book.

I see two overriding threads in her considerations.

First, she argues that a claim that ends up gaining popularity is often not
based on consensus among the experts. Acceptance is can result from
ideological preferences, the charisma of the claiming scientists, and
sensational press coverage.

Second, she argues that requiring consensus by using the "gold standards" of
rationality is too strict a demand for gaining actionable knowledge about a
claim. 

The gold standards may not apply in a given situation. And in cases where
their achievement is impractical, useful information can still be gained
by using less restrictive standards, and by heeding to evidence from
non-experts engaged with the domain at hand.

For example, doctors, care givers, and the patients themselves will have useful
information about a medical issue. Thus, there is a middle ground of reliability
of evidence between purely-circumstantial and scientifically-decisive that can 
usefully inform our decision making.

What is more, such evidence is often bolstered by plausible predictions of known
scientific cause-effect processes.

The question that remains is what standards should apply to the use of such
methods in our decision making? 

The obvious high-level answer, as suggested in the chapter, is a kind of
Pascal's wager: Compare the expected cost of informing a decision by a partially
substantiated claim with the expected cost of not doing so.

What remains to be worked out are the details of putting the Pascal wager to
practice. I am not sure if progress is being made on that front in the
scientific and philosophical communities.

Following are the specific incidents of seeming scientific controversy and
instability discussed in the chapter.

Limited Energy Theory

The so-called 'limited energy theory' was used to advocate against higher
education for women, by applying conservation energy to female physiology.

The limited energy theory was based on three assumptions: that women can only expend a certain
amount of energy per day, that child bearing and child rearing requires
significant energy, and that work on higher education also requires significant
energy. The conclusion was that higher education takes away energy that should
more profitably be used on child bearing.

Oreskes details a number of methodological issues with the evidence for this
claim and shows that there was in fact no scientific consensus for it at the time.

Two general issues stand out for me. 

First, the argument is "philosophical", that is, described in generality at a
high level, without an explanation of the mechanisms involved. A simple detail
of the pertinent mechanisms, for example, might have been an estimate of the
amount of energy needed for each type of activity. Once the details of the
mechanisms are given, possibilities will present themselves for falsification
based on the different predictions of the offered mechanisms. 

Second, this looks like an obvious case of confirmation bias. There is some
underlying ideology that women should mostly attend to child bearing and child
rearing. Then you apply certain high-level scientific principles to justify that
ideology, without providing the details. And you ignore or downplay contrary
evidence, for example, the application of those same principles at the same
level of detail to similar situations yielding false predictions.

Continental Drift

When the theory of continental drift was first proposed by Alfred Wegener of
Germany in early 1900's, there was a sharp transatlantic divide on the efficacy
of the so-called "hypothetico-deductive" approach to science. 

"Hypothetico-deductive" is a fancy name for the common idea of formulating
hypotheses about a natural phenomenon, explaining reality in terms of the
deductive predictions of the hypotheses, and testing for the correctness of the
predictions. European scientists like Wegener tended to do science in that
fashion.

Many American scientists, on the other hand, were suspicious of the bold
guesswork used in forming the hypotheses in that approach. They argued that an
incremental "purely inductive" approach is a more secure way of doing science.
In a purely inductive approach, observations, lots of them, come first. Then one
looks for "obvious" emerging regularities in the observational data, and
inductively formulates laws based on those regularities. Careful science, it was
argued, would proceed cautiously in small incremental and "natural" inductive
steps.

Today it is clear that hypotheses generally rely on seeing regularities based on
observations anyway. And "natural" inductions must involve some level of
hypothesis formation by informed guessing. So the two ideas are fused in today's
scientific method.

Perhaps this controversy reflects general cultural differences on the two sides
of the Atlantic. Entertaining a bold untested hypothesis required some level of
trust in the authority of its proponents. And American culture is arguably
distrustful of authority.

Because of the American distrust of the hypothetico-deductive method, Wegener's
hypotheses about the possible explanation of continental drift by currents in
the earth's mantle did not receive the attention it deserved at the time.

The question for me is: what is the solution when there are two seemingly
competing scientific methods favored by different communities of experts in a
field? I guess the answer is Lakatos's research programs. Try to fund
both programs. But that issue is not somehing that is taken up in the chapter.

This controversy also points to a dilemma for scientists confronting their
colleagues and the public at large.

Some people tend to react negatively to science know-it-alls that try to project
authority - is Anthony Fauci a current American example? Such scientists are
perceived as trying to use their authority rather than reason to persuade.

But suppose the scientist is humble and allows for doubt. Are people going to
give him the benefit of the doubt?

Eugenics

Oreskes provides convincing evidence of the lack of scientific consensus 
on eugenics at the time of its popularity. 

Eugenics arguments for the control of reproduction suffered from a number of
known shortcomings: implicit unjustified assumptions, confirmation bias, lack of
experimental evidence, fallacy of the excluded middle: attributing an effect to
just one of many causes, ignoring that it could be a result of several causes.

What is the scientific question here? That the human race can be improved by 
promoting reproductive practices that enhance fitness, assuming that we have a
definition for fitness. As a purely philosophical question, it seems like a
reasonable question to try to answer scientifically.
I am not sure whether there was consensus in principle on that philosophical
question.

From there we have to go on and provide the definition of fitness, and the
specific mechanisms of reproductive control, and provide experiments to prove or
falsify the claim. When we try to go that far, seemingly insurmountable issues
emerge and the idea collapses scientifically and morally. 

Eugenics appears to be yet another example of ideology masquerading as science.
A high-level seemingly plausible philosophical claim is used to promote
practices favored by a popular ideology. And the general population does not
stop to ask about the debunked scientific and moral justifications of the
details.

Hormonal Birth Control and Depression

The question raised in this section is how much evidence is enough for 
acting on a scientific claim.

The observed statistical link between the Pill and depression has been reported
ever since the pill was introduced. A recent mega study from Denmark has
confirmed the link as statistically significant. In the process, it has cast doubt on
whether earlier studies used correct methodologies. Those earlier studies did not
reach the same level of statistical significance, and may have been error-prone
due to self-reporting. However, the earlier studies were bolstered by the finding
of a link between sexual hormones and serotonin levels. Serotonin is known to be
a mood-altering substance.

So the question is: to what extent should the information in support of 
the effect of hormonal contraceptives on depression have been paid attention to
before the Danish study (that is, assuming that the shortcomings of those
earlier studies were understood)?

Assuming that the link between sexual hormones and seratonin has been
scientifically established, it would seem reasonable, as Oreskes argues, to take
the earlier not-so-accurate studies at least somewhat seriously.

Oreskes suggests, for example, that a 90% confidence interval is not
significantly different from 95%. And yet, there are various studies that 
discard results obtained with confidence levels below 95%.

Dental Floss

There were two claims with respect to flossing - that it helps reduce tooth
decay, and that it reduces the chance of gingivitis. The facts of the matter,
seem to be as follows. 

Cochrane is a respected third party fact checker of evidence-based health
information. In 2011 Cochrane did a review of evidence for flossing. It checked
the data on all existing trials of flossing in the presence of brushing. It
found no evidence from the available studies that flossing reduces tooth decay.
And it found only scant, though statistically significant, evidence 
a reduction in gingivitis.

Oreskes's argument here is similar to the case of hormonal therapy. She asserts
that there was self-reporting by dentists and patients that flossing produces
healthier teeth. And there is at least some scientific explanation of a
mechanism whereby flossing improves dental health.

Once again, the question becomes how to treat subpar evidence for a claim in
decision making.

Flossing provides an example of a case where the gold-standard double-blind
experiment cannot be employed. So what should be the silver and bronze standards 
in these cases? 

My simple example along these lines is whether we need a clinical trial to
recommend that children be kept away from fires? Anecdotal accounts of a few
such incidents do not prove the scientific claim of adverse effects from heat. 
Yet a few observed incidents of severe burns should settle the issue for most 
reasonable people, it seems.
