Very briefly,

Science has to a large extent become hostage to the security needs of the state.
As such, scientists have learned to balance secrecy with the openness that seems
to be essentail to the practice of science. The thus compromised state of
science and scientists promotes distrust.

People easily accept technology, which, of course is based on science.
So empahsizing the role of science in the gadgets we use every day can enhance
people's view of science.

My two cents. People believe in technology because of its immediacy in their
lives. The effects of vaccines and climate change are statistical and
distributed, and not immediate for many people. It is easy for critics to
dismiss ideas whose effects are not immediately visible.
