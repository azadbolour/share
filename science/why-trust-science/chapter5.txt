Very briefly.

Science is used to aid in decision making. But decision making also involves
other considerations, chief among them people's value systems.

In using science for decision making, we can distinguish between two types of
knowledge: (1) the knowledge of how the world works, and (2) the knowldge of how
(1) affects policy outcomes. Both should rest on a rational basis. 

But insufficient attention has been paid so far to the the "science" of making
predictions about policies in general by using both types of knowledge. In
doing so, it is important to assess, scientifically, the impact of a policy
based on (1) on people's lives in their totality, including on people's values
and belief systems.

The authors have proposed the beginnings of a framework for including both
scientific facts about how the world works, and a ratiomal basis for including
different value systems in policy making, in choosing an appropriate policy
among competing alternatives. This framework may be considered as a detailed
elaboration of the Pascal Wager.
