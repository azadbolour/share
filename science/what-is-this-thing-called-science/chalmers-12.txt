Chapter 12 - The Baysian Approach

Like Chalmers, I remain unconvinced about the applicability of Bays thoerem to 
the likelihood of the correctness of a theory based on evidence.

So I don't think it is useful to get into the details of the theorem and its
adaptation to scientific evidence.

However, what motivates this line of enquiry is of some interest. Basically, as
we have seen, a proposed theory is confirmed by some observations and falsified
by others (the anomalies). It is then natural to ask whether one can come up
with a calculus, which, based on the strength of the evidence and strength of
the anomalies, would yield a degree of confidence in a theory. That would solve
the all-important question of when one theory is to be considered more
believable than another.

The Baysian approach is one such attempt. But its application is heuristic, and
relies on subjective probabilities. Probability theory, of which Bayes is a
theorem, on the other hand, is based on a foundation of objective probabilities.
So it is difficult to justify Bayes as a rational method of assigning confidence
to theories.

For the details see the chapter.
