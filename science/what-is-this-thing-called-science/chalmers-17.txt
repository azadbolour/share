Work in progress.

Philosophical atoms vs scientific atoms.

Science confirmed "by appeal" to experience - as opposed to "derived from"
experience. Empirically supported.

Appeal needs "appropriate" notions of confirmation and empirical evidence. 

Fallibility - limited scope, incorrect evidence.

Strong sense of confirmation. I guess large number of experiments, different
conditions, survive stringent tests, evidence for all the predictions.

Replaced theories as limiting cases of their replacements. In the contexts
in which they were confirmed they remain valid.

Realism becomes problematic because theories can be superceded beyond their
observed limits, and the picture of the world provided by the more general 
theory may be radically different from that provided by the earlier thoery.

However, there are elements of theories that it would be silly to think of as
unreal. We can say that they are as far as we know practically real. Chalmers
considers the elctron as practically real.

But the distinction still seems rather subjecive. 

For me, practically real is just good enough. The ontology provided by a
well-confirmed theory is just practically real. We don't have to worry 
about whether it is actually real. Just like we don't have to worry about
whether a scientific fact is absolutely true. 

So rather than speaking of reality and truth which will get us into trouble,
we can just speak of well-confirmed models of the world.

This reduces the issue to the still ultimately subjecive issue of what 
constitutes a well-confirmed theory.

If we think of a well-confirmed theory as basically an abstraction or
factorization of regular observations spanning the entire range of the
applicability of the theory, then it is almost by definition the case that the
theory is correct. The problem is that we cannot possibly observe experimentally
the entire range of applicability of most interseting theories. 

However, assuming that our observations are close enough to areas where
we claim the theory applies to but have not been directly observed, 
it would be quite a coincidence if the theory is not an approximation 
to the situation in the entire range of claimed applicability.

Chalmers considers this type of argument as valid only if the evidence is very
strong and he has a number of criteria for the strength of the evidence.

1. Stringent objective tests.

2. The complete theory has to be stated up front and tests evaluated 
   against that complete theory. If you keep finding anomalies and keep 
   tinkering with the theory (e.g., as in Ptolemy's epicycles) then that 
   is a theory "smell". This is the idea of "accomodation"  of a theory 
   to experimental evidence that has not in my mind been precisely defined.

3. Possibilities of error.

   One thing is that a theory may contain multiple sub-theories, 
   and we may not have specific evidence for the specific sub-theories,
   and in fact they could be wrong.
   
   An example is Newton's particle theory of light which conjectured 
   assumptions about the attraction of light by materials, etc. which 
   were just conjectures - not independently tested.
   
   Another issue is that to test a theory one may have to make assumptions
   about the domain of tests, and those assumptions may be wrong.

   An example is the assumption about the distance of the stars in testing
   for parallax that seemingly falsified Copernicus. In this case, the distance 
   assumptions were false.

4. Complete tests of all parts of a theory. The tests purported to confirm a
   theory may only confirm a subset of the postulates of the theory. So care must
   be taken to partition a theory into orthogonal postulates, and claim only those
   potulates that are actually needed to explain the existing observations made in
   experiments so far. An example given is that Newton's theory postulates 
   absolute space, but experiments only deal with the relative positions 
   of the bodies involved and not with absolute space per se.

5. Variety of phenomena explained by a theory. The wider the range of seemingly
   distict phenomena phenomena and discoveries confirming a theory, the stronger is
   the case for the thoery. For example, Newton's theory explains planeray orbits,
   billiard balls, tides, etc. It would be an amzing coincidence if the theory were
   just plain wrong.

Chalmers considers the fact that historically accepted theories were rejected 
outright, e.g., Aristotelian theories, as insufficient evidence for the
rejection of currently accepted theories. Some of those theories were 
not confirmed by evidence, I guess, using even the standards of evidence 
of the day. 

But in any case, we now have much better standards of evidence which reduce the
chance of the fallibility of currently accepted theories. 

I guess our standards of rationality and evidence can be improved by future
generations, and by those standards, those future generations can crtitique
the acceptance by us of certain theories. But we can only use the best standards
of rationality at our disposal at a given time. That is the best we can do
in approximating reality.

Other past theories were well-confirmed by our current standards, and in those
cases they remain valid as limiting cases of the theories that superceded them.

The difference between philosophical and scientific theories. As exemplified by 
the atomic theory of matter.

Anceinet philophers attempting to explain the nature of change were able to
explain change as a rearrangement of constituent particles.
But this was an explanation of how change CAN happen. They did not show in any
diect manner that this is the way change DOES happen. Similarly the atmomists of
the 17'th century (Newton and Boyle) could show that an assumption of the atomic
nature of matter CAN be used to explain certain natural phenomena. But according
to Chalmers they too did not produce strong evidence for the actual atomic
nature of matter. I am wondering about the details of the arguments by Newton
and Boyle and how they differed from the notions of strong evidence listed by
Chalmers. Maybe that will become clear later in this chapter.

In any case, when Chalmers talk about "accommodating" a theory to en experimental
observation, what I think he has in mind is that the ontology and machanisms proposed by
the theory CAN be used to explain the observation. But that strong evidence has
not been offered for the claim that that ontologgy and set of mechanisms
actually describes the underlying reality.

However, for me personally, the fact that the theory can be used to explain 
observed phenomema is some sort of evidence. So the question becomes does 
there exist an objective notion of evidence that is qualitatively different 
from the explanatory property of theories that can be taken to signify 
"strong" evidence. Or are we mainly concerned with the degree of explanatory 
power - that is the number of phenomena that fall within the context of 
theory that can be explained by the theory, and once the additional needed
assumptions for those explanations are added to the theory, the number of 
phenomena that should be but are not yet explained by the theory?

Chalmers' claim is that strong evidence for the "atomic" nature of matter
was first provided by J.J. Thompson's cathode ray experiments. I don't 
understand the details of those experiments sufficiently to satisfy myself 
of the nature of the kinds of confirmation they provide in relation to 
the notion of accommodation and explanatory characters of theories.
To be figured out.

One idea of strong confirmation is that different and unrelated experiments by
Peter Zeeman had also pointed to the existence of charged particles.  Again the
real implications of this independent verification are beyond me as I don't
understand the details of the Zeeman experiment. Chalmers argues that the 
nature of the electron was forced on us by the results of experiments.
And he contrasts this with earlier partculate theories that were something
like pure speculations. I am not sure I understand this difference as 
a qualitative distinction. I am going to need more details. 

In any case, the way I see a qualitative distinction (and I am not sure if it
captures the gist of Chalmers's arguments) is this. A speculative theory is one
which: 

1. Either is not really a scientific theory because it has not worked out the
details of the ontology and the mechanisms involved in its explanations. This
is clearly the case for the anceinet atomic theories. Change can possibly be
explained by a particulate theory, but no details are given as to how it
actually occurs.

2. Or it has speculated on the details, but those details have not been
subjected to serious experimental tests.

In other words, a theory that has merely argued that it CAN possibly explain 
certain phenomena but has not specifed the details of how, or to the extent it
has specified them, they have not been subjected to rigorous experimental tests,
is an "accommodating theory".

Note that by this definition of mine the Ptolemian theory of the planets is 
not really an accomodating theory just because it includes epicycles.

Perhaps you will find in Chalmers a clearer and more convincing explanation 
of the distinction betwen an accommodating theory and a strongly confirmed one.
Or maybe it will be clarified further later in this chapter.

An interesting and extreme example of falsification of a theory with supposedly
strong evidence is the explanation of Brownian motion by the kinetic theory of
molecules at the time. In the 1900's Jean Perrin conducted a series of extremely
careful experiments for observing the behavior of Brownian motion particles. The
results of these experiments perfectly fit the kinetic theory of molecules.
Unfortunately, it turned out later that the theory as kknown at the time of
Perrin included false postulates concerning the equilibrium of different types
of motions of a particle accounting for its kinetic energy.

The takeaway is that Perrin was mainly concerned with Brownian motion. But the
underlying kinetic theory had variuos unrelated consequences that only later 
were found not to exist.

In the case of Brownian motion, specific assumptions used in the kinetic theory
of molecules that were use to explain Brownian motion by Perrin were simply
wrong.

A different issue arises when the specific assumptions of a theory are in fact
not needed to explain a phenomenon, but the theoretician is nontheless wedded 
to them. The example given by Chalmers is Dalton's atomic theory of matter.
Chalmers proposes that the existence of atoms as basic constituents of matter 
was not needed to account for most (all?) of 19'th century chemistry. 
Thus chemical formulae can just as well be interpreted as describing quantities
of diferent materials as atoms of different material used in a combined
chemical. If that is indeed the case, then 19;th century theory of chemical 
reactions could be "partitioned" into orthogonal dimensions concerning (1) the 
relative quantities of different elements participating in a chemical reaction,
and (2) the atomic nature of matter. And the contention is that only the
quantititative laws of chemistry were proven by 19'th century experiments, 
and not the atomic nature of matter.
