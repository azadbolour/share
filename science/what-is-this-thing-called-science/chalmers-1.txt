Chapter 1

The basic issue is that different observers can see the same thing 
differently.

In describing an observation as a fact, we formulate statements in terms of
linguistic or mathematical symbols. Here we are just talking about describing 
what we see. We are not yet talking about formulating scientific theories.
How scientific theories are formulated comes later. 

The process of formulating a statement of observed fact starts with the retinal
image of the observation, goes through a process of perception in the brain, and
a process of verbalization of that perception in some language.

The process of perception will be different for different people, depending on
what the brain decides to concentrate on, and on the existing model (theory) of
the world in the specific brain, for example, the current way real-world objects
are categorized in a given brain.

So formulating statements of facts about observed phenomena presupposes a model
of the world. The model can change over time, and statements of observed facts
about the same phemomenon in the old model may no longer be valid in the new
model.

My initial thought is to set aside the issue of different perceptions by
different brains, by stipulating that statements of fact about a phenomenon are
made not by humans but by machines. The machine is programmed to include 
a given model of the world, to observe certain phenomena, and to print out 
a statement. The statement can be in a precisely defined mathematical language.
Then a statement of the fact of an observed phenomenon will include the machine
that was used to observe it, as well as what the machine printed out.

Then scientific theories may be formulated by saying, for example, that if
machine M1 prints X then it will print f(X) a little while later.

There is still the issue of the legitimacy of the machines, of course.
But the confusion of different observers is finessed.
