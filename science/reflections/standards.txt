Because of inherent human limitations in actually knowing things, scientific
claims are generally only our best guesses on particular aspects of reality.
And such guesses, not being certain, will generally have associated levels of
confidence.

What are the rules by which we judge evidence for scientific claims, guess that
the totality of evidence favors or disfavors a claim, and attach a level of
confidence to our guesses? 

As civilizations progress, such rules can change, hopefully in a positive
direction by allowing better guesses to be made with more confidence. 

It is also possible that the rules vary among different scientific communities.

However, if we have any hope of being "rational" about our scientific claims, it
seems that we need to be explicit about the rules governing our guesses.

I call these rules the standards of rationality [at a given time and for a given
community, though I will not repeat these qualifications in every use of the term]. 

I would include as a basis in those standards, the rules of logic, and the rules
of arithmetic.

TODO. Spell out all the rules we know about.

Note that in my definition of standards of rationality, I have explicitly
excluded mention of the rules that may govern the day-to-day work of scientists.
Clearly, there are also standards of reasonable conduct in particular scientific
communities at any given time, some of which may be motivated by the governing
standards of rationality.

But it is important to make a distinction between the activity of judging a
claim based on evidence, on the one hand, and the activity of attempting to 
produce evidence for or against a claim on the other. In my terminology,
"standards of rationality" are rules that apply to the former activity. 
To make this distinction clear, we may call the rules that apply to the latter 
activity "standards of procedure".

I tend to avoid using the common term "scientific method" because to me 
it confounds the two concepts of judgement and procedure in science.

I am willing to allow considerable flexibility in procedure. 
But when it comes to judgement, it seems to me, we need a firm grip on 
the governing constituitional regime. The bar for changing the constitution, 
that is, our standards of rationality, should be quite high. We can't just 
change those standards willy-nilly, lest we make a mockery of rationality.

In 'Why Trust Science?', Naomi Oreskes argues for scientific consensus as 
the main requirement for a scientific claim. That characterization, while
clearly relevant, misses the point in my view. It gives the impression 
that the validity of a claim is merely a matter of the opinion of the 
expert practitioners in a field, without acknowledging the idea of the
rationality or irrationality of a claim relative to a set of standards.

Clearly, judging the evidence for a claim cannot be entirely a matter of the
opinions of a number of people, whatever their level of expertise. To the extent
that our standards of rationality are spelled out, they must be applied in
verifying a claim independently of opinion. Where the standards are vague and
leave room for opiniotated judgement, of course, that level of judgement is
unavoidable. However, a judgemnet that is not based on the canonized standards
of rationality should be called out as such, and clearly it must be given less
weight than a judgement that is supported by the standards.
