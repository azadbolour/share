The emacs command "C-c C-," does not work for me on Agda goals, and I am not
sure how to fix it. Similarly for C-. and C-;. Using agda 2.5.4.2.

Clues are:

1. In my terminal (iTerm2), CTRL+, is mapped to a simple comma. 

2. In emacs the same mapping is inherited. So when I do "C-c - C-," emacs
responds with the error: "C-c , is undefined".

The regular MAC terminal does not allow CTRL-, input.

Am I correct in assuming that it is the responsibility of agda-mode to do the
necessary terminal magic to map CTRL+, to the right code? 

I guess I can try to map CTRL+, to the right code in the my
terminal preferences. But I am not sure what that code should be.

Workaround

Thw workaround is to change the associated keyboard shortcut in the file
agda2-mode.el. I had originally changed C-c C-, to C-c C-g (for goal),
and did similar changes for "C-c C-." amd "C-c-C-;".

But Scott Coderberg came up with the clever trick of just changing "C-c C-,"
to "C-c ,". Since the terminal just sends a "," for "C-,", typing
"C-c C-," [as specified in the emacs command documentation] gets
translated to "C-c ," and just works! Similarly for "C-c ." and "C-c ;".

Sample:

    ;; (agda2-goal-and-context               ,(kbd "C-c C-,")     (local)        "Goal type and context")
    (agda2-goal-and-context                  ,(kbd "C-c ,")       (local)        "Goal type and context")

My agda-mode.el is at: ~/Library/Haskell/share/ghc-8.4.4-x86_64/Agda-2.6.0/emacs-mode/agda2-mode.el
where my agda is: ~/Library/Haskell/bin/agda.
