The emacs command "C-c C-," does not work for me on Agda goals, and I am not
sure how to fix it. Similarly for C-. and C-;. Using agda 2.5.4.2.

Clues are:

1. These are not available as menu options in the Agda menu list of emacs.

2. In my terminal (iTerm2), CTRL+, is mapped to a simple comma. 

3. In emacs the same mapping is inherited. So when I do "C-c - C-," emacs
responds with the error: "C-c , is undefined".

The regular MAC terminal does not allow CTRL-, input.

Am I correct in assuming that it is the responsibility of agda-mode to do the
necessary terminal magic to map CTRL+, to the right code? 

I have also looked at the agda-mode files. But have not found where the mapping
of control characters can be defined.

I guess as a last resort I can try to map CTRL+, to the right code in the my
terminal preferences. But I am not sure what that code should be.

Is there an Agda forum for asking these kinds of newbie questions? So far all I
know about is the mailing list referred to here:
