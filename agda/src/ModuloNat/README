Overview

The basic idea is to define a successor function for modular numbers
and define modulo + based on succession. The successor function is a
normal function, not a constructor. Unlike the natural number 'suc'
constructor which goes on forever, the successor function for modulo
numbers cycles after 'modulus' successions.

Proofs are then based on the properties of the modular succession
function.

There are three basic theorems:

First, the sequence of increasing modular numbers results from the
repeated application of the successor function starting with modular
zero.

Second, modular succession cycles at the modulus.

Third, addition of two modular numbers can be represented as a
function of the addition of the corresponding natural numbers.

These and various conveniene lemmas are then used to prove the group
properties of of modulr numbers for the sigma representation.
